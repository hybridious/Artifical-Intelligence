Although this is not an open source project :). I am just keeping track of my work here.



1st Check Point Goals: 


What I Have Finished:



Speech Output

twitter.com/0xret2plt has finished this


NLP algorithms; this is needed because It will have human interactions and inputs. FINISHED

finished this


- API; NOT DONE

finished this


- Facial Recognition; Uses dlib to detect common facial expressions, detect mood, all based on several factors. FINISHED

 - UI; not very important at the start, but the bot does need a user interface. 

finished this




- Linear regression algorithm; that will interpert the data from the inputs and find the common trends that will help with further          analysis of data and, eventually, the neural network. 



What we Still Have to Do:


  Frontend(should not take long, but includes some deep learning programming):



- Speech-to-text code; takes speech input and converts it to text. Includes natural language processing. This is the first step to          converting human-omitted information for the machine to understand. More work will need to be done on the neural network part of          this to get it working. (NOT DONE)












- Data parser; before data is to be passed through the linear regression algorithm it needs to be parsed for effiency and quickness.        (NOT DONE)






Backend(this is the hard part, this should take the longest since it involves the most challenging tasks):



- Neural network; this comprises of many things, but I am researching and making sure I have all the frontend done and ready           before moving on to this. (NOT DONE)


- Database; eventually,  I will to store some inputs that help with teaching the algorithm. This is probably going to happen         after everything else is done. (NOT DONE)





obviously, this will use many machine learning algorithms, because of the amount of variables I will use reinforcement learning. To do that I have to keep training the models. This is linked to the DB and will be done after it. (NOT DONE)
      


Project may take several months. I am using github just as a way to track progress on both ends of the project. 



Libs I am using:


http://dlib.net/ This is used in our program.
