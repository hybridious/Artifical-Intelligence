Although this is not an open source project :). We are just keeping track of our work here.



1st Check Point Goals: 


What we Have Finished:
Speech Output

twitter.com/0xret2plt has finished this


NLP algorithms; this is needed because we have human interactions and inputs. FINISHED

twitter.com/0xret2plt  has finished this




What we Still Have to Do:


  Frontend(should not take long, but includes some deep learning programming):


- Facial Recognition; Uses OpenCV with dlib to detect common facial expressions, detect mood based on several factors. (not done)

twitter.com/0xret2plt will do this, deadline nov 24 2017


- Speech-to-text code; takes speech input and converts it to text. Includes natural language processing. This is the first step to          converting human-omitted information for the machine to understand. More work will need to be done on the neural network part of          this to get it working. (NOT DONE)

twitter.com/0xret2plt will do this, deadline pushed further
- This might take a bit longer, over estimated this a little bit.



- Linear regression algorithm; that will interpert the data from the inputs and find the common trends that will help with further          analysis of data and, eventually, the neural network. (NOT DONE)
twitter.com/skidematician will do this, deadline: nov 26 2017





 - UI; not very important at the start, but the bot does need a user interface. (NOT DONE)





- Data parser; before data is to be passed through the linear regression algorithm it needs to be parsed for effiency and quickness.        (NOT DONE)
twitter.com/skidematician will do this, deadline: nov 30 2017




- Statistics and calculus solutions; before writing the code, a mathematical representation is needed to make things easier for us         and to be understood. (NOT DONE)



Backend(this is the hard part, this should take the longest since it involves the most challenging tasks):



- Neural network; this comprises of many things, but we are researching and making sure we have all the frontend done and ready           before moving on to this. (NOT DONE)



- Database; eventually, we will have to store some inputs that help with teaching the algorithm. This is probably going to happen         after everything else is done. (NOT DONE)



- API; this is probably never going to happen, if it becomes big, maybe a watson-like API.


1obviously, this will use many machine learning algorithms, because of the amount of variables we have       we will use reinforcement learning. To do that we have to keep training the models. This is linked to the DB and will be done after      it. (NOT DONE)
      


Project may take several months. We are using github just as a way to track progress on both ends of the project. 



Libs we are using:
